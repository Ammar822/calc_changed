Original Project Functionality
The original calculator app is a basic, interactive calculator that allows users to perform standard arithmetic operations. It includes:
•	Basic operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
•	A clear (AC) button for resetting the input
•	An equal (=) button to compute results
•	Buttons for numeric input (0-9), decimal points, and basic arithmetic operators.
Added Features
In this version, we've enhanced the app with three major features:
1. Dark/Light Mode Toggle
•	User Story: As a user, I want to toggle between dark and light mode so I can use the calculator comfortably in different lighting environments.
•	Description: A toggle button is added to switch between dark and light modes. When the dark mode is enabled, the background and text colors adjust to provide a more eye-friendly experience in low-light conditions.
•	Technical Requirements:
o	Added a darkMode state in App.js
o	CSS classes for both dark and light mode in App.css
o	Button for toggling between modes in the top-right corner of the app.
•	Files Modified: App.js, App.css
•	Challenges: Ensuring smooth transitions between modes without causing layout or visibility issues for buttons or text.
2. Backspace Button
•	User Story: As a user, I want to be able to remove the last entered character in case of mistakes.
•	Description: A backspace button (←) is introduced that removes the last character from the current input without affecting the calculation.
•	Technical Requirements:
o	Added a new button with the label "←"
o	Implemented logic to remove the last character from the next state on button click.
•	Files Modified: ButtonPanel.js, Button.js, App.js, App.css
•	Challenges: Ensuring the backspace button works smoothly without causing issues in ongoing calculations.
3. History Feature
•	User Story: As a user, I want to view my previous calculations and easily restore them.
•	Description: A history feature is added that displays the last 5 calculations. The user can click on any item from the history to restore the result.
•	Technical Requirements:
o	A history state to store the last 5 results
o	UI component to display the history and clickable items to restore the results
•	Files Modified: App.js, ButtonPanel.js, Button.js, App.css
•	Challenges: Managing the history state effectively, ensuring it doesn't overflow, and making it intuitive for the user to interact with the history list.
Implementation Process
1. Dark Mode
•	We added a state darkMode to the App.js component.
•	Conditional rendering was used to toggle between light and dark CSS classes.
•	The CSS was updated to reflect changes in background colors, text colors, and button styles based on the mode.
2. Backspace Button
•	We created a new button labeled "←" and added it to the button panel.
•	The backspace button was linked to a new function that removes the last character from the displayed input (next state).
•	We ensured that the backspace operation did not interfere with ongoing calculations.
3. History Feature
•	A history state was introduced to store the last 5 calculations.
•	The history is displayed under the calculator interface, and each history item can be clicked to restore the result.
•	The history list updates dynamically as new calculations are made, keeping only the last 5 entries.
Challenges Faced and Solutions
1. Dark Mode
•	Challenge: Finding the right balance between readability and aesthetics in dark mode.
•	Solution: We carefully selected contrasting colors for buttons and backgrounds to ensure readability in both modes. Smooth transitions were added for better user experience.
2. Backspace Button
•	Challenge: Ensuring that the backspace functionality didn't interfere with active operations or the overall calculation flow.
•	Solution: We wrote a specific function for the backspace button that only manipulates the current input (next state), leaving the calculation process untouched.
3. History Feature
•	Challenge: Managing the history state to avoid unnecessary data overflow and ensure it remains user-friendly.
•	Solution: We limited the history to the last 5 results and implemented a dynamic rendering of history items that can be clicked to restore a previous calculation.
Aider Commands Used and Their Effectiveness
We used Aider for a variety of tasks throughout the implementation, including:
1.	Dark Mode: "Help me implement a dark mode toggle that changes the background color of the app. Also, the text and button colors should adjust based on the mode."
2.	Backspace Button: "Add a backspace button that deletes the last character in the displayed value without affecting the calculation results."
3.	History Feature: "Create a history feature that stores and displays the last 5 calculations. The user should be able to click on a history item to restore the result."
Aider’s suggestions and code snippets were incredibly helpful, especially when it came to the layout adjustments for dark mode and adding the history functionality. The backspace button implementation also benefited from Aider’s clear and concise instructions.

Reflection
Most Effective Aider Techniques Discovered
•	Aider was most effective in quickly providing code snippets for new features like the backspace button and history functionality. It helped me avoid reinventing the wheel by suggesting efficient methods.
Limitations Encountered
•	One challenge was integrating the suggested changes into the existing codebase without breaking the existing features. Aider didn’t always give the exact solution for some more complex UI adjustments.
Comparison to Traditional Coding Workflow
•	Using Aider saved a significant amount of time by offering immediate solutions and suggestions, which would have typically taken longer to research or debug manually. However, it still required some manual tweaking to ensure it worked seamlessly with the app.
Suggestions for Improving Aider for Similar Tasks
•	Aider could be improved by offering more in-depth explanations for each suggestion, especially when dealing with UI-related issues that require a deeper understanding of how styles and components interact.
•	An improvement could also be made in understanding the context of existing code to suggest more fitting and compatible solutions.
